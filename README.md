## Hello there, stranger

I don't really know how you landed here, but I will try to show a little bit about myself for you. ;)

## Public information

My name is Daniel Reis, a.k.a DanielHe4rt. I currently live in S達o Paulo, Brazil and my goal is to help many developers to achieve their goals as soon as possible.

I founded [He4rt Developers](https://github.com/he4rt) in 2018, a community focused to help junior developers into their baby-steps. For 5 years I leaded and learned community management there and now my next step is to create a global community. (soon)

I've also streaming [LiveCoding sessions at Twitch.tv](https://twitch.tv/danielhe4rt) almost daily since 2018 by learning concepts and teaching at the same time, elevating the "Learn in Public" concept to a whole new level. With that, started to write articles on [Dev.to](https://dev.to/danielhe4rt) and create videos on [YouTube](https://youtube.com/danielhe4rt), which was the  game changer action for my Career as a Developer. 

## Detailed information

* **Name**: Daniel Reis
* **Age**: 24
* **Living in**: S達o Paulo - SP, Brazil
* **Stack**: PHP - Laravel - Bootstrap - SQL - CQL - AWS - Azure
* **Learning**: Rust and Databases

## Curiosities about me

* I took music classes for 10 years, playing classical guitar, violin, violoncelo, bass and singing in a choir that was the reference in the state of S達o Paulo at that time. My final presentation in this way was in the ["Sala S達o Paulo"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sala_S%C3%A3o_Paulo), which is the **biggest and greatest** theater in Brazil;
* I started with coding in 2011 using **Pawn Lang**, switching lines and doing the "try/error" approach on a **GTA San Andreas** gamemode only to see if something changes in game;
* I had a "sensei" who taught me a lot about programming and he made a huge progress with this knowlegment. Today I just did the same he did for me in the past to any people that asks me for help;
* I already had 2 private MapleStory servers (Java), 3 GTA SA:MP  private servers (Pawn) and 1 Minecraft Server (Java);
* I really like to help people and learn random things.
