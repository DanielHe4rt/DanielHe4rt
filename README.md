## Hello there

I don't really know how u got here, but I will try to show a little bit about myself for you.

## Public information

My name is Daniel Reis. I currently live in São Paulo, Brazil and my work is to solve bugs at my twitch channel. 

On my free time, I manage the @he4rtdevs community, which is basically a place where beginners search for people who wants to help new developers to find a direction of "know how" to code.

Nowadays I decided to focus on my TwitchTV channel and make entertainment with coding stuffs and build random projects while I try to teach something of these steps of "know how" to my viewers.

## Detailed information

* **Name**: Daniel Reis
* **Age**: 22
* **Living in**: São Paulo, Brazil
* **Stack**: PHP - Laravel - Bootstrap - SQL - AWS
* **University**: Nope. Only have one I.T associate degree.

## Curiosities about me

* I did 10 years of music classes playing classical guitar and singing in a choir which was  reference in the São Paulo state at that time. My final presentation on this road was at the "Sala São Paulo", which is the biggest and greatest theather in Brazil;
* I started with coding using **Pawn Lang**, switching lines and doing the "try/error" approach on a GTA San Andreas gamemode only to see if something changes in game;
* I had a "sensei" which teach a lot about programming and he made a huge progress with this knowlegment. Today I just made the same he did for me on the past at the He4rt Developers;
* I already had 2 private MapleStory servers (Java), 3 GTA SA:MP  private servers (Pawn) and 1 Minecraft Server (Java);
* I really like to help people.
